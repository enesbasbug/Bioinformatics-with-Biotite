#### Bioinformatics with Biotite

+ What is Biotite
+ Biotite is like a Swiss army knife for bioinformatics
+ It can handle a major part of the typical workflow for sequence and biomolecular structure data:
    - Searching and fetching data from biological databases
    - Reading and writing popular sequence/structure file formats
    - Analyzing and editing sequence/structure data
    - Visualizing sequence/structure data
    - Interfacing external applications for further analysis


    
#### Modules of Biotite
+ Sequence:functionality for working with sequence information of any kind
+ Structure:enables handling of 3D structures of biomolecules
+ Applications:provides interfaces for external software, in case Biotiteâ€™s integrated functionality is not sufficient for your tasks
+ Database:searching and downloading data from biological databases, including the arguably most important ones: the RCSB PDB and the NCBI Entrez database.

#### Installation
+ pip install biotite
