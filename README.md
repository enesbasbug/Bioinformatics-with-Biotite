#### Bioinformatics with Biotite

+ What is Biotite
Biotite is a Python package for computational biologists. It aims to provide a broad set of tools for working with different kinds of biological data, from sequences to structures. On the one hand side, working with Biotite should be computationally efficient, with the help of the powerful packages NumPy and Cython. On the other hand it aims for simple usability and extensibility, so that beginners are not overwhelmed and advanced users can easily build upon the existing system to implement their own algorithms.
+ Biotite is like a Swiss army knife for bioinformatics
+ It can handle a major part of the typical workflow for sequence and biomolecular structure data:
    - Searching and fetching data from biological databases
    - Reading and writing popular sequence/structure file formats
    - Analyzing and editing sequence/structure data
    - Visualizing sequence/structure data
    - Interfacing external applications for further analysis


    
#### Modules of Biotite
+ Sequence:functionality for working with sequence information of any kind
+ Structure:enables handling of 3D structures of biomolecules
+ Applications:provides interfaces for external software, in case Biotiteâ€™s integrated functionality is not sufficient for your tasks
+ Database:searching and downloading data from biological databases, including the arguably most important ones: the RCSB PDB and the NCBI Entrez database.

#### Installation
+ pip install biotite
